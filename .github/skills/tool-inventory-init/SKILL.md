# Tool Inventory Init: The Librarian's Setup 🛠️

Initialize the semantic Tool Inventory for a new project. This is the **first-run** workflow for tracking executable scripts. 

> **Architecture Note**: This skill delegates the actual data storage and generation to the `rlm-factory` plugin, but it strongly enforces a pre-configured schema specifically for `plugins/` and `plugins/` scripts.

## When to Use

- Setting up Agent Skills inside a new root project repository.
- Rebuilding the tool inventory ledger from scratch after severe corruption.
- Moving from legacy JSON-only tracking to modern RLM tracking.

## Interactive Setup Protocol

### Step 1: Execute Initialization Script 

Run the automated bootstrapping script. This script will ensure `.agent/learning/rlm_profiles.json` exists and will inject a `tools` profile if it doesn't. 

```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/tool-inventory-init/scripts/tool_inventory_init.py
```

### Step 2: Serial Agent Distillation

The script above creates the target manifest, but **YOU** (the Agent) will execute the initial distillation pass if Ollama is unavailable, or you can delegate to batch mode if the project is massive.

Check what needs to be cached using the auditor:
```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/../rlm-factory/skills/rlm-curator/scripts/inventory.py --profile tools
```

*If there are uncached tools:*

**Option A (Agent Distillation) - Recommended for < 20 tools:**
For each file identified as missing:
1. Read the tool script.
2. Summarize its purpose, layer, and CLI usage.
3. Write the summary into `.agent/learning/rlm_tools_cache.json`.

**Option B (Batch Distillation) - Recommended for > 20 tools:**
```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/../rlm-factory/skills/rlm-curator/scripts/distiller.py --type tool
```

### Step 3: Verify

Run the audit again to confirm 100% coverage:
```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/../rlm-factory/skills/rlm-curator/scripts/inventory.py --profile tools
```

## After Init

- The semantic registry is now active. You no longer need to run this command.
- Use `manage_tool_inventory.py` (inside the `tool-inventory` skill) to register single new scripts organically during development.
