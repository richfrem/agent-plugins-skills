# Universal Agent Plugins & Skills Ecosystem

## Project Overview

A strictly cross-platform (Windows, Mac, Ubuntu) library that serves as the universal upstream source for reusable AI agent plugins and skills across multiple IDEs and agent frameworks:

- **Claude Code**, **GitHub Copilot**, **Gemini CLI**, **Antigravity**, **Roo Code**, **Windsurf**, **Cursor**, and other compliant integrations.
- *Now universally supporting the single `.agents/` folder standard (no duplicate copies needed for `.github`, `.gemini`, `.agent`, etc).*

**119 skills** across **23 plugins** — all maintained from a single hub-and-spoke source tree.

---

## Core Philosophy: Transitional Architectures & Decoupled Skills

This repository is built on a pragmatic acceptance of the current AI engineering landscape: **the ecosystem changes weekly, and workflows that were revolutionary six months ago are obsolete today.**

Frameworks like `agent-agentic-os` and `spec-kitty` are treated as **Transitional Architectures** — bridges between what agents need to do today and what native SDKs will eventually handle. When Anthropic, Google, and GitHub harden native memory persistence, execution safety, and multi-agent orchestration, large swaths of this tooling will be happily discarded.

**Skills are Applications; the SDK is the OS.** Individual skills must function in complete isolation — no hard dependencies on sibling plugins, no assumptions about which framework is running.

## Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Start here — fresh clone or first-time setup.** The single `.agents/` environment directory is **not committed** to your repo. It will be empty by default.
>
> All installation methods (**uvx**, **bootstrap.py**, **npx skills**, and **Marketplace / Extension CLI**) are now consolidated in a single authoritative guide:

## Architecture Highlights

### Triple-Loop Autonomous Skill Improvement

The `agent-agentic-os` plugin implements a **Triple-Loop** architecture for continuous, autonomous skill improvement:

| Layer | Agent | Role |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **L0** | `triple-loop-architect` (Claude) | Interactive setup: scaffolds isolated sibling lab, seeds all files, launches L1 |
| **L1** | Gemini CLI (`gemini --yolo --model gemini-3-flash-preview`) | Headless orchestrator: reads `eval-instructions.md`, runs the loop, gates via `evaluate.py` |
| **L2** | Copilot CLI (`gpt-5-mini`) | Cheap mutation proposer: proposes SKILL.md edits using free Copilot quota |

The loop is autonomous and cost-effective: L2 uses GitHub Copilot's `gpt-5-mini` (free quota), enabling 20–80 mutation proposals per run at near-zero cost. L1 (Gemini Flash) orchestrates unattended overnight. `evaluate.py` is the absolute gate — exit 0 = KEEP, exit 1 = DISCARD + auto-revert.

**Not all skills are good candidates** — the best targets have clear, objective routing criteria and adversarial eval cases. Use [`eval-autoresearch-fit`](plugins/agent-scaffolders/skills/eval-autoresearch-fit/SKILL.md) to score a skill before running a loop.

**To start any evolution activity — improvement loop, capability gap fill, or pattern abstraction:**
```
/os-architect
```
Describe what you want in plain language. The `os-architect` agent classifies intent, audits the ecosystem, proposes Path A/B/C, and dispatches via your available CLI tools. `os-evolution-planner` writes the task plan + delegation prompt. `os-architect-tester` validates after any changes.

**To start a loop directly on a specific skill:**
```
@triple-loop-architect

Kick off a 10-iteration Triple-Loop optimization run targeting the `<skill-name>` skill
inside the `<plugin-folder>` plugin. Use gemini-3-flash-preview as L1 and gpt-5-mini as L2.
```
See the full sample prompt: [`references/sample-prompts/triple-loop-architect-prompt.md`](plugins/agent-agentic-os/references/sample-prompts/triple-loop-architect-prompt.md)

**Live example — `convert-mermaid` skill, 26 iterations across 2 rounds: 0.61 → 1.00**

![convert-mermaid eval progress](plugins/mermaid-to-png/skills/convert-mermaid/evals/eval_progress.png)

Each blue diamond is a baseline anchor (one per session). Green = new best score. Amber = kept but not a record. The two-segment shape shows a fresh re-baseline for round 2 — the plotter handles this automatically.

Monitor a live run: `python plugins/agent-agentic-os/scripts/plot_eval_progress.py --tsv <lab>/evals/ --live`

**Flywheel layers:**
- **OUTER flywheel** (`os-improvement-loop`): improves OS-level protocols and session ledgers between sessions
- **INNER flywheel** (`os-eval-runner` + `os-skill-improvement`): improves individual skill routing accuracy within a session
- **Overnight** (`os-nightly-evolver`): runs the INNER flywheel unattended — see [`agents/os-nightly-evolver.md`](plugins/agent-agentic-os/agents/os-nightly-evolver.md)

### Karpathy Autoresearch Loop

Skills that score HIGH on the autoresearch viability rubric (objectivity + speed + frequency + utility) can run fully autonomous self-improvement loops:

```
mutate SKILL.md → evaluate.py → exit 0 (KEEP) or exit 1 (DISCARD) → repeat
```

**Ecosystem Fitness Sweep v1 is complete** — all 116/120 production skills scored for autoresearch viability. Results:

| Verdict | Count | Loop Type breakdown |
|---|---|---|
| HIGH | 9 | DETERMINISTIC: 41 · LLM_IN_LOOP: 59 · HYBRID: 16 |
| MEDIUM | 52 | |
| LOW | 42 | |
| NOT_VIABLE | 13 | |

Full ranked list: [`summary-ranked-skills.json`](plugin-research/experiments/analyze-candidates-for-auto-reseaarch/skills/eval-autoresearch-fit/assets/resources/summary-ranked-skills.json)
Top 20 opportunities with metrics + blockers: [`autoresearch-opportunities-report.md`](plugin-research/experiments/analyze-candidates-for-auto-reseaarch/skills/eval-autoresearch-fit/assets/resources/autoresearch-opportunities-report.md)

**First live autoresearch loop**: `verification-before-completion` from `obra/superpowers` (35/40 HIGH) — golden task set + `evaluate.py` scaffolded, ready to run.

### Hub-and-Spoke ADR

All shared scripts live once at `plugins/<plugin>/scripts/`. Skills reference them via file-level symlinks (`skills/<skill>/scripts/script.py → ../../../scripts/script.py`). Directory-level symlinks are forbidden — `npx` drops them on install.

**Super-RAG stack:** `rlm-factory` (O(1) keyword) + `vector-db` (O(log N) semantic) + wiki nodes (full concept)
