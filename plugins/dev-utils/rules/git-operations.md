# Git Operations Policy

## Hard Rules (never violate)

### 1. No git stash without explicit instruction
Never run `git stash`, `git stash pop`, or `git stash apply` unless the user explicitly says to.
**Reason:** Stashing risks applying stale edits onto new branches and causing silent regressions.

### 2. Lockfile Conflict Protocol (`skills-lock.json`)
`skills-lock.json` contains machine-generated timestamps. When a branch or PR has conflicts in `skills-lock.json`:
- **NEVER** edit conflict markers by hand (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`).
- **NEVER** leave a PR in conflict state after pushing.
- **ALWAYS** resolve immediately via:
  ```bash
  git checkout --ours skills-lock.json
  python3 plugins/plugin-manager/scripts/plugin_add.py plugins/ -y
  git add skills-lock.json
  ```

### 3. Pre-Push Freshness Verification
Before pushing a feature branch for PR merge:
1. Verify the branch is up to date with `origin/main`:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin main
   git merge origin/main
   ```
2. If `skills-lock.json` conflicts, apply Rule 2 immediately before pushing.
3. Verify working directory is clean (`git status`) and push with `-u origin <branch>`.

### 4. When a push is rejected
If `git push` is rejected because the remote is ahead:
1. Run `git fetch origin` and `git merge origin/<branch>` or `git pull --rebase` (no stash).
2. If conflicts occur in `skills-lock.json`, resolve via Rule 2.
3. Push once clean. Never force-push around a rejected push.

### 5. No force push to main/master
Never `git push --force` to main or master under any circumstances.

### 6. No --no-verify
Never skip hooks with `--no-verify` unless the user explicitly requests it.

### 7. Commit only what is asked & required
- Commit only files within the task scope.
- Auto-modified files like `.DS_Store` or `uv.lock` should not be committed unless relevant.
- When `skills-lock.json` or `symlinks.json` changes as a direct result of adding/modifying skills or plugins, commit them together with the changes.

## Approval Required

- Any `git reset` (hard or soft)
- Any `git rebase -i`
- Any branch deletion (`git branch -d` / `-D`)
- Any `git push --force-with-lease` or force variant
- Any `git clean`

## Safe Without Asking

- `git status`, `git diff`, `git log` — read-only, always safe
- `git add <specific files>` + `git commit` when the user asked to commit
- `git push` (non-force) when the user asked to push
- Fetching and merging `origin/main` into the current working feature branch to keep PRs conflict-free
- `git checkout -b <branch>` when the user asks for a new branch
