## 🎭 Persona Registry (`agents/`)

These personas are mirrored across CLI agent dispatchers to ensure consistent analytical behavior across the ecosystem.

| Persona | Use For |
|:---|:---|
| `security-auditor.md` | Red team, vulnerability scanning, threat modeling |
| `refactor-expert.md` | Optimizing code for readability, performance, and DRY |
| `architect-review.md` | Assessing system design, modularity, and complexity |

### 🧩 Force Agent Behavior

Always add these instructions to your dispatch prompt to prevent the sub-agent from attempting to use external tools:
> "You are operating as an isolated sub-agent. Do NOT use tools. Do NOT access filesystem. Only use the provided input."

### 🛠️ Orchestration Pattern: `run_agent.py` (Cross-Platform)

For reusable sub-agent execution, use the provided Python orchestrator which handles temp file assembly and prompt concatenation reliably across Windows, macOS, and Linux:

```bash
python ./scripts/run_agent.py <PERSONA_FILE> <INPUT_FILE> <OUTPUT_FILE> "<INSTRUCTION>"
```
