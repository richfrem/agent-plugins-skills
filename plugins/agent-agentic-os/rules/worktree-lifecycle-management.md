# Worktree Lifecycle Management

## The Problem This Rule Solves

Worktree-related changes frequently suffer from ambiguity when multiple git states (uncommitted local work, committed on a branch, pushed to remote, merged to main, local ref updated, and checked out on disk) are collapsed into the vague word "done". This leads to confusion about where files actually reside and whether PRs or branches are safely integrated.

## The Law

> **A worktree-related change is not "done" until you state which of the six states below
> it is actually in, using the exact vocabulary below.** Never use the bare words "done",
> "merged", "pushed", or "saved" without one of these qualifiers attached. When the user
> asks "where is X" or "is it gone", answer with the state name and the exact path/branch,
> not a general reassurance.

## The Six States (use this exact vocabulary)

1. **Written in the worktree** -- exists only as an uncommitted file inside the worktree's
   working directory. Invisible to git log, invisible to any other checkout, lost if the
   worktree is deleted.
2. **Committed in the worktree** -- has a commit hash, but only reachable from the
   worktree's local branch. Invisible outside this machine.
3. **Pushed to origin** -- the branch exists on GitHub. A PR *can* be opened. **Not yet
   merged.** State the exact `git push` result and the PR URL, and say explicitly "not
   merged yet" in the same sentence.
4. **Merged into `origin/main`** -- verify this yourself via `git fetch origin main &&
   git log --oneline origin/main -3` and quote the actual merge commit hash back. Never
   infer this from "I pushed it" or from the user saying "ok" -- confirm the merge commit
   exists on `origin/main` before calling anything merged.
5. **Local branch ref updated** -- `git fetch origin main:main` (or equivalent) updates
   what your local `main` branch *points to*. **This does not change any file on disk if
   the current checkout has a different branch checked out.** Always state explicitly
   which branch is currently checked out (`git branch --show-current`) in the same breath
   as reporting this.
6. **Checked out on disk** -- the actual working directory files match the target branch.
   Verify with `ls`/`git status` on the real path, not by inference. Only at this state can
   you tell the user "you can see it now" -- and even then, name the exact path.

## Non-Negotiables

1. **State the state.** Every progress report on worktree-related work names which of the
   six states applies, e.g. "pushed to origin, PR link below, not yet merged" or "merged
   into origin/main (commit `988b77a`), but your checkout is still on
   `feature/x` -- run `git checkout main` to see it."
2. **Never say "merged" without verifying `origin/main` yourself.** A user saying "I
   merged" is a trigger to `git fetch` and quote the resulting commit hash, not license to
   parrot "merged" back without checking.
3. **Never claim a file is visible "now" without checking the actual checked-out branch.**
   Updating a local branch ref is not the same as changing the working directory. If the
   current checkout is on a different branch than the one just updated, say so before the
   user has to ask why they can't see anything.
4. **State exact full paths for every file/plugin/worktree you reference.** "It's in
   the new plugin" is not an answer; state the exact path (e.g. `/full/path/to/plugins/<plugin>/scripts/script.py`).
5. **Before deleting any worktree, verify state 4 (merged into origin/main) first**, via
   `git fetch` + `git log origin/main`, not by assuming a prior push means the PR was
   merged. Only after that verification, delete via the native worktree-removal tool (or
   `git worktree remove` + `git worktree prune` if the native tool reports no active
   session), and confirm via `git worktree list` that it's gone.
6. **All symlink creation/removal inside a worktree goes through
   `.agents/skills/symlink-manager/scripts/symlink_manager.py`**, per
   `.agent/rules/plugin-architecture-policy.md` Section 5 -- this applies inside worktrees exactly as
   much as the main checkout. If the tool isn't present in the worktree, restore it from
   the marketplace-cached copy or the sibling monorepo before touching any symlink, never
   fall back to raw `ln -s`.
7. **When multiple worktrees exist, or worktree work spans several turns, restate the
   current state of every open worktree at the start of any status report** -- don't make
   the user re-derive it from scattered messages.

## Where This Applies

- Every worktree session in the repository.
- Every report to the user about progress on worktree-based work, from creation through final deletion.
- Applies in addition to, not instead of, `worktree-subagent-leak-detection.md` (which covers subagents writing outside assigned worktrees). Both apply simultaneously in any subagent session run inside a worktree.
