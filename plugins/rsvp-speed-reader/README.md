# rsvp-speed-reader

A plugin and skill for AI-assisted **Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP)** speed reading.

## What is RSVP Speed Reading?

RSVP is a speed reading method popularized by tools like [Spritz](https://spritzinc.com/). Instead of scanning across a page, words are **flashed one at a time in the same fixed position**. One letter in each word is highlighted (typically in red) as a visual anchor called the **Optimal Recognition Point (ORP)** — the character your eye naturally gravitates to for fastest recognition.

This approach dramatically reduces eye movement, which is one of the main bottlenecks in traditional reading. At calibrated speeds (200-600+ WPM), readers can increase throughput while maintaining solid comprehension.

## What this Plugin Does

This plugin converts any document into a structured **RSVP token stream** — a JSON array where each entry contains the word, its ORP index, display delay, and flags for sentence/paragraph boundaries. The token stream can then be consumed by a UI component or agent to drive a reading session.

**Supported input formats:** `.txt`, `.md`, `.pdf`, `.docx`

## Skills

| Skill | Description |
|---|---|
| `rsvp-reading` | Parses a document and generates an RSVP token stream with ORP alignment and WPM-based delays |

## Agents

| Agent | Description |
|---|---|
| `rsvp-comprehension-agent` | Session manager for interactive RSVP reading with pause/resume/speed control |

## Dependencies

Declare dependencies in `requirements.in`, then compile:

```bash
cd plugins/rsvp-speed-reader
pip-compile requirements.in
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Core deps:** `pdfminer.six` (PDF parsing), `python-docx` (DOCX parsing). Plain `.txt`/`.md` use stdlib only.
