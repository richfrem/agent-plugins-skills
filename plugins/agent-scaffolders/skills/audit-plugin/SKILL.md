# Ecosystem Auditor

## Overview
This skill acts as the final CI/CD review gate for the agent ecosystem. It delegates to the `agent-plugin-analyzer` to execute a deep, multi-dimensional semantic scrub of a target plugin against our strict Level 4 specifications.

## Instructions
When instructed to audit or validate a plugin, or to verify if a skill is compliant, use the Python analyzer script. Do not use legacy basic audit scripts.

**Usage:**
```bash
python3 "./scripts/analyze_plugin.py" --dir <path-to-plugin> --security
```

*(Note: Always run with the `--security` flag to catch P0 malware heuristics before reviewing architecture.)*

**Parameters:**
- `--dir`: The absolute or relative path to the root of the plugin being audited.

**Audit Checks Include:**
- **Open Standards Validation:** Run `skills-ref validate <path-to-skill>` to definitively catch frontmatter parse errors, length constraints, and required fields (`name`, `description`).
- **Naming & Content Constraints:** Verify the skill name uses the **gerund form** (`verb + -ing`, e.g., `analyzing-spreadsheets`). Reject generic nouns. Ensure the `name` exactly matches the parent directory. Verify `description` is written strictly in the **third person**.
- **Execution Patterns (L4):** Checks for Graduated Autonomy, Source Transparency, Escalation Triggers.
- **State Management:** Checks for conditional inclusions and explicit state checklists.
- **Architectural Strictness**: Validates `CONNECTORS.md`, `README.md`, YAML frontmatter purity. Verifies `SKILL.md` uses 1-level deep relative file references ONLY and is < 500 lines. Enforces that all supporting files are strictly organized into the official `scripts/`, `references/`, or `assets/` directories.
- **Security Vectors:** Flags un-sandboxed execution, prompt injection vulnerabilities, and raw binary execution. Ensure utility scripts use explicit error handling, not silent punting or voodoo constants.

**Remediation & Next Steps:**
If the script outputs a low Maturity Score or fails the `--security` gate (which forces an immediate `sys.exit(1)`), you MUST read the generated output report and actively use your file editing tools to fix the compliance issues in the target plugin. Run the audit again until it achieves Level 3 or higher.


## Next Actions
- Offer to run `create-skill` to fix identified gaps.
- Offer to run `create-stateful-skill` to upgrade to L4 maturity.
